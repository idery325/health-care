Health Care Project
Overview

This project started on September 21, 2024, and aims to build a healthcare service that works across web, Android, and iOS platforms using React Native. In the future, it plans to integrate with wearable device APIs, such as the Galaxy Watch, to track health data in real-time and provide personalized health insights to users.

The ultimate goal is to deploy a cross-platform application that will be available on web and mobile (Android, iOS). The app will feature basic health data tracking tools, helping users easily manage and monitor their health status.

Currently, the project is in the early stages, focusing on building the client-side UI and basic data input functionality.
